 Tonya Harding says the Olympics have changed since she competed all those years ago.

 "Wow, I'm so glad I'm not competing against them now," Harding says of the Olympic figure skaters, noting that the "point system" has changed.

"I was all about doing the triple axel or the triple-triple, and now you can do the triple-triple and still get the same points that you would for the triple axel.

So, why do the triple axel?"  Harding was the first American woman to successfully do a triple axel in a competition, and recalls the moment she knew she landed the move.

"I was like, 'Yes! I did this!'" she says.

"I competed for me but I performed for the people."  Harding also remembers being at the Olympics and thinking, "Holy crap."  "Then you have to remember to bring yourself back down to a level that this is just another competition," she explains.

"You're like that for a bit and then you start to look around and you're like, 'Holy crap, this is the Olympics.'"  Harding has found herself back in the limelight this year after the success of the movie I, Tonya, which is about her life as a figure skater.

She tells DeGeneres that she's quite happy with how the film turned out.

 "I achieved something in my life that meant something," she says.

"With the new movie, it actually made my life feel like it was worth something."  In January, Harding joined the I, Tonya cast at the Golden Globes and celebrated with Allison Janney after she won for her portrayal of LaVona Golden, Harding's mother.

 "She was overwhelmed by the movie," Janney told ET's Kevin Frazier of Harding's reaction to the critically acclaimed film.

"I think she's having a great moment.

I think she loves it and I think she should because the movie tells a more nuanced side of her story."  Janney added, "It's much more complicated then what we first thought when this incident happened back in the '90s."  Check out more of our exclusive interview with the Golden Globe winner:.

Story highlights Margulies talks about life after Alicia Florrick The actress is currently working on a new film  CNN —  Julianna Margulies isn’t missing “The Good Wife,” just yet.

 The actress, who just wrapped the series finale of her long running CBS drama in June, told CNN she’s only beginning to adjust to life after Alicia Florrick.

 “I haven’t missed [the show] yet,” she told CNN at The ACE Awards in New York on Tuesday night.

“We probably would be in our third week back at work now if I was still doing it.

I really wonder, now that I have the time to think about it, how I did seven years of that show because just the legal dialogue alone.

My mind was never still.”  Margulies said that right after she taped the last episode, she got sick.

“I have been really actually wondering how I just kept going.

So the exhaustion when it all finally ended, hit me with a bout of the chickenpox for two weeks.

I felt like, sort of my body having to shut down and shed seven years of great hard work and start anew.

I really took it that way.”  Related Link: ‘The Good Wife’ series finale reaches a frustrating verdict  Margulies, who has won two Emmy Awards for her work on “The Good Wife,” admitted that she was surprised the hit show wasn’t nominated this year.

 “I thought this season was our strongest season, to be honest,” Margulies said.

“It’s someone else’s turn.

I’ve won plenty and I’ve been nominated plenty.”  Margulies didn’t pause long before for taking on a new role.

She’ll play Richard Gere’s wife in the upcoming movie, “The Three Christs of Ypsilanti.” The film is already in production and Margulies said she’s enjoying her new gig.

 “Oh, it’s heaven,” she said.

“He is genuine, he’s not fussy [Gere].

After our first day, it was as if we had been married for 10 years already.

He’s just lovely, I mean honestly, he’s truly a dream.”.
