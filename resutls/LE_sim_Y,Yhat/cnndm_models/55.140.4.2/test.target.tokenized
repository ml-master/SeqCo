In recent months , hundreds of migrants have been relocated to a dormitory on New York City 's Upper West Side , causing concerns among residents . The father of one of the world 's biggest stars , Joe Germanotta , who has lived in the affluent area for 35 years and also owns and runs a local restaurant , spoke to the New York Post to explain his stance on the issue . According to Joe , the problems started when NYC turned the Stratford Arms Hotel , a residence hall for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy , into a shelter for 500 migrants . He described the situation as a " stealth operation " that occurred in the middle of the night , with migrants bused in without any notice to residents . Joe alleged that migrants have been throwing block parties outside the hotel that run into the early morning hours , recklessly riding e-bikes and scooters on one - way streets , and engaging in prostitution . He also claimed that girls as young as 14 are getting catcalled , and that residents are dealing with verbal abuse . There is also evidence of trash piling up on what used to be clean streets , causing property values to drop and leaving residents feeling helpless . Joe believes that about 500 migrants are living in 400 rooms that are only large enough for a bed and refrigerator and that everyone is sharing bathrooms , a typical college dorm setup . He added that the migrants are locked into these rooms and go out at night to party . Despite the fact that Joe believes the migrants are " good people , " he is concerned about the lack of proper security , police presence , and code of conduct in the area . He is lobbying City Hall for better policing and supervision while the migrants are there and has some advice for the mayor . In his opinion , the city should have suspended " sanctuary city " status until they had enough housing and then allowed more migrants to come . He suggested that the city could get one of the cruise ships , which hold more people and are a more controlled environment , instead of spending money on building affordable housing . Overall , Joe 's concerns highlight the challenges that some residents face when migrants are relocated to their neighborhoods . While the migrants may be good people , the lack of proper security , policing , and planning can cause problems for both the migrants and the residents .

In a recent interview , Julianna Margulies , who plays Kitty Montgomery on AMC 's Dietland , discussed the character 's unique personality and how she created such a big persona right out of the box . Kitty is based on a real - life person and was the first character Sarai Walker wrote in the book . Margulies wanted to fit Kitty into the world that Plum Kettle , the main character , is living in and weigh the balance of what Plum is going through with the balance of what Kitty is going through . Kitty 's world is so completely superficial , and she 's always posing , which makes her forget herself and get emotionally involved , which is uncomfortable . Margulies read the book right after reading the first five scripts and was impressed with how true to the book it was . She believes that the real weight falls on Marti and on Joy Nash , the writer and executive producer , respectively , because the writing of the book and the main character are so rich . Margulies can not imagine another person in Plum Kettle 's shoes than Joy Nash , and she believes that Marti and Joy really nailed it . Although Kitty is so self - involved , she does keep referring to " her girls , " who represent the false narrative within the magazine industry that she created . Kitty is truly aghast at what Plum looks like and wants to cash in on the plus - size revolution , but she realizes that Plum represents the magazine , which would never happen . Kitty is the antithesis of Daisy Chain , which is the magazine that Plum works for . In Episode 2 , Kitty denies Plum the chance to attend the plus - size fashion show , which is the underlying dynamic at play between these two . Margulies hopes that people connect to Plum Kettle 's character and that the show changes any current narratives about women and their bodies .

Pink , the celebrated singer - songwriter , recently discussed her extensive career and the personal traumas she has processed through her music with Vulture . She revealed that it can be challenging to keep track of all the songs she has written , given her 17 - year career and seven albums , each of which she has written or co-written nearly every song . Pink has always used writing as a means to cope with her interior life as well as the state of the world , and she often writes songs that make room for escapism , hoping that people will join her in getting out of their heads for however long they need . Pink recently released her new album , Beautiful Trauma , and to celebrate , we asked her to look back at her nearly two - decade - long body of work and pick the best songs she has ever written . Some of her picks include " Dear Mr . President , " " Stop Falling , " " Crystal Ball , " " Family Portrait , " and " I Do n't Believe You . " These songs are not only some of her most popular and successful , but they also hold personal significance to her . For example , " Dear Mr . President " was written in response to the divisive political climate at the time , and Pink played it for her dad , who supported her decision to write and record the song . " Stop Falling " was written when Pink was just 18 and reflects on her early years as a musician . " Crystal Ball " and " Family Portrait " both deal with the healing power of music and the importance of talking openly about personal struggles . " I Do n't Believe You " is a vulnerable song that marked a turning point in Pink 's marriage to husband , Carey Hart . Meanwhile , legendary singer Little Richard has made headlines recently for his comments on homosexuality . In a new interview , he described same - sex relationships as " unnatural affection " and stated that he intends to live his final years " like Jesus . " This is a departure from his previous statements , in which he came out as a gay man and declared that he knew God was a God of love , not of hate . At the age of 84 , it is unclear whether Little Richard 's views on homosexuality have changed or if he has simply chosen to modify his public statements .

Secure the cotton ball with aluminum foil to hold it in place . The acetone will dissolve the gel polish , which can be removed by gently scraping off the softened gel with an orange wood stick . Poole advises waiting 10 to 15 minutes for the acetone to work its magic and to give your nails some TLC after removal , such as using a gentle buffing block to smooth out the nail 's surface and soaking the nails with cuticle oil .

" Eventually , the dynamic became unhealthy for Lawrence . " I finally was just like , ' It 's not healthy . Neither of us are doing it because if I read it , I start getting defensive .

Jenna Dewan , the actress and dancer , has recently become a beauty guru , revealing secrets to achieving enviable , thick , and natural eyebrows . In her YouTube channel video , she shares her five - step trick to naturally gorgeous eyebrows . The first step is to use a spoolie to brush the brow hairs up and out , away from the eyes , so that they take up more space on the brow bone . The second step is to use a waxy pencil , like the Anastasia 's Brow Definer Pencil , to make tiny dashes on the tops of brows to strengthen the line , while still looking natural . The third step is to continue brushing the hairs up with the spoolie to help blend the pencil line with the hairs . The fourth step is to stop plucking the bottom edges of the arches because it makes the lines look too harsh . The fifth and final step is to hold the look together with an inexpensive drugstore find , the $ 6 Maybelline 's Great Lash Clear Mascara . This mascara is not necessarily a brow gel , but it 's clear mascara and it works just as good , and it stays all day . According to Dewan , thick eyebrows are so trendy because they frame a face , and she makes a strong case for embracing the bold eyebrow . Another trend that is taking off is the cat eye .

Jimmy Kimmel is set to host the 2018 Oscars on ABC this Sunday , and he 's hoping for a repeat of last year 's Envelopegate gaffe , in which Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong film as best picture . Despite efforts by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and its accountant to avoid another debacle , Kimmel jokes that he wants it to happen again , especially since no one blamed him for it . He also reveals which of the nine best - picture nominees he believes is the ripest for joke material , saying that " The Shape of Water is about a woman who has sex with a sea monster . So probably that one — that ’s got to be right at the top . " Kimmel admits that he has watched all of the nominated films and hopes that the audience has also seen them , but he struggled with whittling down " thousands " of jokes from his writers without being able to test them in front of an audience .

When shopping for sunscreen , it 's important to choose a product with an appropriate SPF rating . While a high SPF rating may seem like a better choice , the truth is that SPF is not a consumer - friendly number . According to Florida dermatologist James M . Spencer , MD , an SPF 15 product blocks about 94 % of UVB rays , an SPF 30 product blocks 97 % of UVB rays , and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98 % of rays . So , an SPF 100 product is not twice as good as an SPF 30 product , and it 's important to choose a product that is appropriate for your skin type and the amount of time you 'll be spending in the sun . In conclusion , if you 're looking for a creative Halloween costume idea , consider dressing up as a Bachelor or Bachelorette couple . And when shopping for sunscreen , choose a product with an appropriate SPF rating to protect your skin from the sun 's harmful UVB and UVA rays .

A California judge has ruled that Michael Jackson 's estate and the companies it controls are not liable for the King of Pop 's alleged childhood sexual abuse of celebrity choreographer Wade Robson . Robson first sued in 2013 , claiming that Jackson abused him for nearly a decade . He later said in an amended complaint to his 2013 lawsuit that MJJ Productions , the late musician 's entertainment company , and MJJ Ventures were operations " specifically designed to locate , attract , lure and seduce child sexual abuse victims . " A probate court in 2015 rejected his claim against the estate itself , which left the two business entities as defendants . Judge Mitchell L . Beckloff ruled on Tuesday that MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures were not liable for Robson 's exposure to Jackson as " no one other than Michael Jackson had the legal ability or authority to control Michael Jackson . " He did not rule on the credibility of the allegations themselves . Beckloff also noted that the complaint was n't filed within the statute of limitations . " There is no dispute plaintiff brought this action well after his 26th birthday , " said Beckloff . " Today plaintiff is 35 years old , he was 30 years old when he filed this action four years too late , and his action is barred by the statute of limitations . " Attorney for Jackson 's estate , Howard Weitzman , hailed the ruling in a statement : " The Estate of Michael Jackson believes the court made the correct decision in dismissing Wade Robson 's claim against it . In my opinion Mr . Robson 's allegations , made 20 plus years after they supposedly occurred and years after Mr . Robson testified twice under oath — including in front of a jury — that Michael Jackson had never done anything wrong to him were always about the money rather than a search for the truth . " Robson said he first met Jackson when he was 5 years old after winning a competition run by MJJ Productions in his native Australia . Two years later , his family was invited to stay at the King of Pop 's Neverland Ranch home in California , where he slept in Jackson 's bed and said he was first sexually abused by him . The abuse continued for seven years and ended only when he " began showing signs of puberty " and Jackson was " no longer as interested in him sexually . " Robson had previously appeared as a witness for Jackson 's defense during a separate sexual abuse trial in 2005 in which the pop star was acquitted of child molestation charges . The ruling is a blow to Robson , who had been seeking damages for alleged abuse that he said occurred at Neverland Valley Ranch , where some of the abuse is alleged to have occurred . The judge noted that the complaint was filed four years too late and that the statute of limitations had expired . Weitzman , who is representing the estate of Michael Jackson , praised the judge 's decision , saying that Robson 's allegations were " always about the money rather than a search for the truth . " The estate of the late pop star has been fighting numerous lawsuits related to his death , including claims that he was murdered .
